# Agent directives

This project is a playground for experimenting with Next.js and creative coding.

- run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- run `npm run build` to build the project
- run `npm run start` to start the production server

- When asked to make test-driven development, follow these steps:
  1. Write a specification for the feature that is asked for.
  2. Write a test that will fail, but successfully represent the feature.
  3. Write the code that will make the test pass.
